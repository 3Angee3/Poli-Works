# ATM Practice

A simple ATM simulation in Java.

## Features
- Withdrawals in multiples of 5000
- Validation of balance and amount
- Breakdown of bills (50000, 20000, 10000, 5000)
- Remaining balance update

## Explanation

- This project provides a simple ATM simulation where fundamental structures 
(conditions, loops, Boolean data, accumulators) are applied.
The solution is relevant because it fits the 
unit problem (handling withdrawals in fixed multiples).

## Requirements
- JDK 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

## Run
```bash
javac src/PracticePoli.java
java PracticePoli
