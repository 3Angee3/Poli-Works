This project checks whether a given integer is a **multiple of 100**.  
The user enters an integer, and the program outputs:  
- `"multiple of 100"` → if divisible by 100.  
- `"not multiple of 100"` → otherwise.  

Additionally, inside the `src/` folder you will find an **extra README file about the ATM project**, which is considered an additional file in this repository.
